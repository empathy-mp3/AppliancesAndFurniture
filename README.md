# IKEA

This mod adds roughly 30 cards to Act 1, Act 2, and Kaycee's Mod, based on Appliances and Furniture, costing Bells and Health respectively. Nothing here is *actually* from IKEA (other than the Blahaj side deck), but it's a much better name for the card pack.

This is the first mod I made, so I'm unsure how good the card balance is. I think this playstyle is interesting, though!

Use of the Blahaj side deck included with the mod is highly recommended for the balance of the mod!

# Patch Notes

v1.0.1:
- Made the README much more accessible.
- Added mods as dependencies that the mod doesn't *technically* require to function, but it would be much more convenient for everyone involved if they were listed as dependencies.
- removed folding chairs because they're broken and i dont wanna fix them (because my codebase is so confusing)

v1.0.0:
- Added the cards
